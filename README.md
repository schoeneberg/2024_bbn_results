# 2024 BBN baryon abundance update results

This repository contains results from the paper currently available at [arxiv:2401.15054](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15054). These results are mostly in addition to the tables presented therein, but contain also the same information. This allows for large amounts of information to be transported without making the initial paper overly verbose.

The file covmats.txt contains the various covariance matrices of the &Omega;<sub>b</sub>h<sup>2</sup> and N<sub>eff</sub> parameters (in the case of additional dark radiation). The corresponding datasets and codes are described in the comments in the notation of the paper.
